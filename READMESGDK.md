## SGDK/Marsdev
AI created script for new proyect creation and tooling for new SGDK projects.

The "limitation" of this script is that, for the time being, is path dependant.
This is due to the way the marsdev toolchain was patched to compile on this M4 laptop.
all paths are relative to the current MARSDEV home directory:
* /Users/amanzanilla/Desktop/retrodev/marsdev

## usage:
./create_sgdk_project.sh <<Project_name>> -opt:<<Project_Dir>>

## Created structure
Project files:
  📁 /Users/amanzanilla/Desktop/retrodev/marsdev/<<Project_Dir>>/ is created and -->
  📁 /Users/amanzanilla/Desktop/retrodev/marsdev/<<Project_Dir>>/
  📄 main.c              - Main program
  📄 Makefile           - Build configuration
  📄 README.md          - Project documentation
  📁 src/               - Additional source files
  📁 inc/               - Include files
  📁 res/               - Resources
  📁 boot/              - SGDK boot files

## Steps after succesful completion
  cd /Users/amanzanilla/Desktop/retrodev/marsdev/<<Project_Dir>>
  make          # Build the ROM
  make test     # Test the build

## Additional Information
Using the project structure:
### Adding Resources
1. Place resource files (\`.res\`) in the \`res/\` directory
2. Use SGDK's ResComp tool to process them
3. Include generated headers in your code

### SGDK Documentation
- [SGDK Documentation](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki)
- [SGDK API Reference](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/blob/master/inc/genesis.h)

## Testing
Test your ROM using:
- **Fusion** - Recommended Genesis emulator
- **Gens** - Classic Genesis emulator  
- **Real hardware** - Via flash cart

## Generated by SGDK Project Generator
